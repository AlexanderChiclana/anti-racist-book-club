        <p class="mission">
          The mission of this book club is to take on challenging topics related
          to white privilege and systemic racism. The goal is to become better
          informed on the history of structural racism as it pertains to
          housing, education, policing, the criminal justice system, the
          environment, health, and more. We will also look at the ways that
          BIPOC activists are fighting for change. Right now
          <br />
          <br />
          The book club will be devoted not only to discussing these topics but
          also to taking action and sharing what they’ve learned beyond the
          club’s figurative walls. The goal is to be better allies and
          constantly put in the work to end racism
          <br />
          <br />
          This is not fight club, you should be talking about it

            “In ‘The End of Policing,’ Alex S. Vitale argues that police reforms
            implemented in the wake of Brown’s death — from diversity
            initiatives to community policing to body cameras — fail to
            acknowledge that policing as an institution reinforces race and
            class inequalities by design.‘ The suppression of workers and the
            tight surveillance and micromanagement of black and brown lives have
            always been at the center of policing,’ writes Vitale, a professor
            of sociology at Brooklyn College. Vitale calls for an ideological
            reframing of policing as an inherently punitive practice that
            criminalizes the most vulnerable and marginalized people in the U.S.
            in order to maintain the status quo for white elites. Instead, he
            writes, people should be given the programs and resources they need
            to solve problems within communities in ways that do not involve
            police, courts, or prisons — a path to materializing justice.”
